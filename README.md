Code supporting a plant-themed gamification project.

Initial variant's for FR, but the hope is that I can do more with it--things like self-care bingo, personal achievements, whatever.

Mostly a study and learning project. Note that I haven't done my usual linting yet, hopefully I'll remember to remove this line once I have.



The project consists of a large number of plant bases drawn with 3 "magic" palettes that are swapped out for other palettes, meaning that each base can yield hundreds of color variants. Additionally has a component replacement system for randomized flowers and the like. This lets me generate an obnoxiously large number of plants and plant-adjacent things.

Then there's a bunch of things to do with said plant. The garden generator is arguably the centerpiece one, but you can also "breed" plants and...well, that's about it for now, but there's some nice utils for working with the seeds and generating new ones and all that.

Seeds are "earned" from a core string-to-plant generator or randomized bingo boards.

You could tune this to any purpose by changing the bingo board goals and the label above the generator. 



That said, I'm giving it to a community to start, and allowing/welcoming art contributions, so it'll initially be CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 to protect that art (of course check the LICENSE itself, it takes precedence). Note that "appropriate credit" includes displaying CONTRIBUTORS.md!

After I have a nice stable version, I'll fork and scrub content from any contributor that doesn't opt in to a more permissive license. Maybe MIT? If you really want to use this code ASAP, contact me, I'm not averse to maintaining a "dev art only" branch if there's a need.
